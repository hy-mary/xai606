"Regulations covering scientific experiments on human subjects are strict. "
Subjects must give their informed, written consent, and experimenters must submit their proposed experiments to thorough examination by overseeing bodies.
"Scientists who experiment on themselves can, functionally if not legally, avoid the restrictions associated with experimenting on other people. "
"They can also sidestep most of the ethical issues involved: nobody, presumably, is more aware of an experiment��s potential hazards than the scientist who devised it. "
Nonetheless, experimenting on oneself remains deeply problematic.
"One obvious drawback is the danger involved; knowing that it exists does nothing to reduce it. "
"A less obvious drawback is the limited range of data that the experiment can generate. "
Human anatomy and physiology vary, in small but significant ways, according to gender, age, lifestyle, and other factors. Experimental results derived from a single subject are, therefore, of limited value; there is no way to know what the subject��s responses are typical or atypical of the response of humans as a group.
"How the bandwagon effect occurs is demonstrated by the history of measurements of the speed of light. "
"Because this speed is the basis of the theory of relativity, it��s one of the most frequently and carefully measured quantities in science. "
"As far as we know, the speed hasn��t changed over time. However, from 1870 to 1900, all the experiments found speeds that were too high. "
"Then, from 1900 to 1950, the opposite happened �� all the experiments found speeds that were too low! "
"This kind of error, where results are always on one side of the real value, is called ��bias.�� It probably happened because over time, experimenters subconsciously adjusted their results to match what they expected to find. "
"If a result fit what they expected, they kept it. If a result didn��t fit, they threw it out. They weren��t being intentionally dishonest, just influenced by the conventional wisdom. "
The pattern only changed when someone lacked the courage to report what was actually measured instead of what was expected.
"Recognizing ethical issues is the most important step in understanding business ethics. "
"An ethical issue is an identifiable problem, situation, or opportunity that requires a person to choose from among several actions that may be evaluated as right or wrong, ethical or unethical. "
"Learn how to choose from alternatives and make a decision requires not only good personal values, but also knowledge competence in the business area of concern. "
"Employees also need to know when to rely on their organizations�� policies and codes of ethics or have discussions with co-workers or managers on appropriate conduct. "
"Ethical decision making is not always easy because there are always gray areas that create dilemmas, no matter how decisions are made. For instance, should an employee report on a co-worker engaging in time theft? "
"Should a salesperson leave out facts about a product��s poor safety record in his presentation to a customer? "
Such questions require the decision maker to evaluate the ethics of his or her choice and decide whether to ask for guidance.
"Although the wonders of modern technology have provided people with opportunities beyond the wildest dreams of our ancestors, the good, as usual, is weakened by a downside. "
"One of those downsides is that anyone who so chooses can pick up the virtual megaphone that is the Internet and put in their two cents on any of an infinite number of topics, regardless of their qualifications. "
After all, on the Internet, there are no regulations preventing a kindergarten teacher from offering medical advice or a physician from suggesting ways to safely make structural changes to your home.
"As a result, misinformation gets disseminated as information, and it is not always easy to differentiate the two. "
"This can be particularly frustrating for scientists, who spend their lives learning how to understand the intricacies of the world around them, only to have their work summarily challenged by people whose experience with the topic can be measured in minutes. "
This frustration is then diminished by the fact that, to the general public, both the scientist and the challenger are awarded equal credibility.
"Ecosystems differ in composition and extent. "
They can be defined as ranging from the communities and interactions of organisms in your mouth or those in the canopy of a rain forest to all those in Earth��s oceans.
"The processes governing them differ in complexity and speed. "
"There are systems that turn over in minutes, and there are others which rhythmic time extends to hundreds of years. "
"Some ecosystems are extensive (��biomes��, such as the African savanna); some cover regions (river basins); many involve clusters of villages (micro-watersheds); others are confined to the level of a single village (the village pond). "
"In each example there is an element of indivisibility. "
Divide an ecosystem into parts by creating barriers, and the sum of the productivity of the parts will typically be found to be lower than the productivity of the whole, other things being equal.
The mobility of biological populations is a reason. Safe passages, for example, enable migratory species to survive.
In recent years urban transport professionals globally have largely acquiesced to the view that automobile demand in cities needs to be managed rather than accommodated.
"Rising incomes inevitably lead to increases in motorization. "
"Even without the imperative of climate change, the physical constraints of densely inhabited cities and the corresponding demands of accessibility, mobility, safety, air pollution, and urban livability all limit the option of expanding road networks purely to accommodate this rising demand. "
As a result, as cities develop and their residents become more prosperous, persuading people to choose not to use cars becomes an increasingly key focus of city managers and planners.
Improving the quality of alternative options, such as walking, cycling, and public transport, is a central element of this strategy.
"However, the most direct approach to accommodating automobile demand is making motorized travel more expensive or restricting it with administrative rules. "
The contribution of motorized travel to climate change reinforces this imperative.
