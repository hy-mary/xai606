If we had to encode it in our brains note by note, we’d struggle to make sense of anything more complex than the simplest children’s songs.	1
Instead, the subjects were found to have chosen the same level of perceived effort on the treadmill, the bike, and the stair climber.	1
When the egg of the thief hatches, it kills the host’s offspring and then eats the pollen meant for its victim. 	1
When considered in this light, the visual preoccupation of early humans with the nonhuman creatures inhabited their world becomes profoundly meaningful. 	0
For every toxic substance, process, or product in use today, there is a safer alternative ― either already in existence, or waiting to be discovered through the application of human intellect, ingenuity, and effort. 	1
Baseball games do have all day to be played. But that does not mean that they can go on forever.	1
If we reason that Paula is afraid either of snakes or spiders, and then establish that she is not afraid of snakes, we will conclude that Paula is afraid of spiders. 	1
The representatives for each ward in the capital would have to be resistant to citizens organized in this way.	0
This is the main motive for gossiping about well-known figures and superiors.	1
The chemical industry denied that there were practical alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, predicting not only economic disaster but numerous deaths because food and vaccines would spoil without refrigeration.	1
One common example of this is that people on a diet who try not to think about food often begin to think much more about food.	1
And as far as lovers of art are concerned, they do not look at the movies for imitations of nature but for art. 	1
They do not worship youth.	1
Behavioral economists ― the economists who actually study what people do as opposed to the kind who simply assume the human mind works like a calculator ― have shown again and again that people reject unfair offers even if it costs them money to do so. 	1
Many modern structures exceed those of Egypt in terms of purely physical size. 	1
The partner only has two options. He can take what’s offered or refused to take anything. 	0
As athletes move up the competitive ladder, they become more homogeneous in terms of physical skills. 	1
Starvation can be of practical or instrumental value, even as it is an intrinsic disvalue.	1
She then has the opportunity to offer some amount of it to her partner. 	1
Then the next time we hear it, we hear a lyric we didn’t catch the first time, or we might notice what the piano or drums are doing in the background.	1
But distrust of one who is sincere in her efforts to be a trustworthy and dependable person can be disorienting and might cause her to doubt her own perceptions and to distrust herself.	1
In such institutions it is difficult for the staff to retain optimism when all the patients are declining in health.	1
Their bodies are structurally adapted for moving fast through the water.	1
To begin with a psychological reason, the knowledge of another’s personal affairs can tempt the possessor of this information to repeat it as gossip because as unrevealed information it remains socially inactive.	1
Consequently, any small difference in physical factors can play a huge role in determining performance outcomes.	0
As a result, they shy away from MST, denying that because they are not coaching elite athletes, mental skills training is less important. 	0
The fact that there might be someone somewhere in the same building or district who may be more successful at teaching this or that subject or lesson is based on teachers who close the door and work their way through the school calendar virtually alone.	0
Before denying that the remaining explanation is the correct one, consider whether other plausible options are being ignored or overlooked. 	0
There’s no room for negotiation; that’s why it’s called the ultimatum game. 	1
They are satisfied with grasping the meaning of what they see. 	1
The emphasis on superiority is what we typically see as fostering a detrimental effect of competition.	1
This overstated, often fictionalized version of nature is no more real ― and yet no less real ― to them than the everyday nature right outside their doors, waits to be discovered in a child’s way, at a child’s pace. 	0
The reindeer, however, had a weakness that mankind would mercilessly exploit: it swam poorly. 	1
Similarly, if you found a dead bird or mosquito, you could guess by looking at its wings that flying was its normal mode of transport.	1
Psychologists who study giving behavior have noticed that some people give substantial amounts to one or two charities, while others give small amounts to many charities.	1
The fact that there might be someone somewhere in the same building or district who may be more successful at teaching this or that subject or lesson is lost on teachers who close the door and work their way through the school calendar virtually alone.	1
As a result, they shy away from MST, rationalizing that because they are not coaching elite athletes, mental skills training is less important. 	1
The provision of timely, constructive feedback to participants on performance is an asset that some competitions and contests offer.	1
The dual expressions of this tendency are anthropomorphism (the practice of regarding animals as humans) and totemism (the practice of regarding humans as animals), both of which spread through the visual art and the mythology of primitive cultures. 	1
For higher organisms, the most significant changes in the environment are those produced by the contemporaneous evolution of other organisms.	1
These thieving bees sneak into the nest of an unsuspecting “normal” bee (known as the host), lay an egg near the pollen mass being gathered by the host bee for her own offspring, and then sneak back out. 	1
“Monumental” is a word that comes very close to expressing the basic characteristic of Egyptian art. 	1
Sometimes the awareness that one is distrusted can provide the necessary incentive for self-reflection.	1
With that kind of involvement, the republic might survive and prosper.	1
During its first half century, games were not played at night, which meant that baseball games, like the traditional work day, ended when the sun set.	1
Behavioral economists ― the economists who actually study what people do as opposed to the kind who simply assume the human mind works like a calculator ― have shown again and again that people reject unfair offers even if it costs them money to do so. 	1
It is no accident that fish have bodies which are streamlined and smooth, with fins and a powerful tail.	1
The researchers expected to find that the subjects unconsciously targeted the same relative physiological intensity in each activity.	1
The best competitions promote excellence, not just winning or “beating” others.	1
However, our conclusion is reasonable only if Paula’s fear really does concern either snakes or spiders. 	1
The evolution of a horse’s hoof from a five-toed foot has enabled the horse to gallop rapidly over open plains.	1
The independent self may be more 3 driven to cope by appealing to a sense of agency or control.	1
Direct involvement of citizens was what had made the American Revolution possible and given the new republic vitality and hope for the future. 	1
The typical experiment uses a task called the ultimatum game. It’s pretty straightforward. 	1
Rather incredibly, one archaeologist employed by a treasure hunting firm said that as long as archaeologists are given six months to study shipwrecked artifacts before they are sold, no historical knowledge is found!	0
The reason for this is not the external size and massiveness of their works, although the Egyptians admittedly achieved some amazing things in this respect. 	1
Not all organisms are able to find sufficient food to survive, so starvation is a kind of disvalue often found in nature.	1
It is true that mental skills become increasingly important at high levels of competition. 	1
The pace of the game is therefore leisurely and unhurriedly, like the world before the discipline of measured time, deadlines, schedules, and wages paid by the hour. 	0
They were wrong.	1
Or maybe they would instinctively settle into rhythm at 70 percent of their maximum rate of oxygen consumption in all three workouts.	1
Thousands of organic farmers are proving them wrong.	1
Thus starvation is a disvalue that can help make possible the good of greater diversity.	1
In the practice of totemism, he has suggested, an unlettered humanity “broods upon itself and its place in nature.” 	1
If we know only that Paula has a phobia, then the fact that she’s not afraid of snakes is entirely consistent with her being afraid of heights, water, dogs or the number thirteen. 	1
A pet’s continuing affection becomes crucially important for those enduring hardship because it reassures them that their core essence has not been damaged.	1
Consequently, any small difference in mental factors can play a huge role in determining performance outcomes.	1
For many, this is restricted to information about whether the participant is an award- or prizewinner.	1
Why does the “pure” acting of the movies not seem unnatural to the audience, who, after all, are accustomed in real life to people whose expression is more or less indistinct?	1
Others’ distrust of her might then forbid her to perform her share of the duties in a way that makes her more worthy of their trust. 	0
But that’s not what happened.	1
Without that involvement, the republic would die. 	1
An old man holding a puppy can relive a childhood moment with complete accuracy. His joy and the animal’s response are the same.	1
The fallacy of false choice misleads when we’re insufficiently attentive to an important hidden assumption, that the choices which have been made explicit exhaust the sensible alternatives. 	1
An interesting aspect of human psychology is that we tend to like things more and find them more appealing if everything about those things is not obvious the first time we experience them.	1
Animals, however, have no expectations about mental capacity.	1
Only when the information is repeated can its possessor turn the fact that he knows something into something socially valuable like social recognition, prestige, and notoriety.	1
This is also true of acting in film.	1
Baseball belongs to the kind of world in which people did not say, “I haven’t got all day.” 	1
Suppose we know that Paula suffers from a severe phobia. 	1
Second, and simultaneously, an unconscious monitoring process tests whether the operating system is functioning effectively.	1
Could a “commercial archaeologist” have waited more than a decade or so before selling the finds?	1
An Egyptian sculpture no bigger than a person’s hand is more monumental than that gigantic pile of stones  that constitutes the war memorial in Leipzig, for instance. 	1
The idea of meeting regularly to compare notes, plan common assessments, and share what we did well mostly occurred to us.	0
Eventually, he saw a need for the nation to be  subdivided into “wards” ― political units so small that everyone living there could participate directly in the political process. 	1
Thus the natural world is conceptualized in terms of human social relations. 	1
Starvation helps filter out those less fit to survive, those less resourceful in finding food for themselves and their young.	1
But this seemingly awesome accomplishment of recall is made improbable by remembering the musical process, not the individual notes as such.	0
Some coaches erroneously believe that mental skills training (MST) can only help perfect the performance of highly skilled competitors. 	1
The pesticide industry argues that synthetic pesticides are absolutely necessary  to grow food. 	1
They know that real representation is always explaining, refining, and making clear the object depicted. 	0
This inner weight is the quality which Egyptian art possesses to such a degree that everything in it seems to be made of primeval stone, like a mountain range, even if it is only a few inches across or carved in wood. 	1
Then, to interpret those finds, they had to learn Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian, without which they would never have learned the true nature of the site.	1
There was, in fact, no consistency in measurements of heart rate and oxygen consumption across the three disciplines.	1
The gossip producer assumes that some of the “fame” of the subject of gossip, as whose “friend” he presents himself, will rub off on him.	1
Consider the University of Cambridge study which found that a group of eight-year-old children was able to identify substantially more characters from animations than common wildlife species. 	1
Sometimes, the longer that takes for a work of art to reveal all of its subtleties to us, the more fond of that thing ― whether it’s music, art, dance, or architecture ― we become.	0
If the evidence indicates that the charity is really helping others, they make a substantial donation.	1
They have no memories about what the aged once was and greet them as if they were children.	0
He was prescient in understanding the dangers of limited power, whether in corporations or in political leaders or exclusionary political institutions.	0
This is certainly true in music. For example, we might hear a song on the radio for the first time that catches our interest and decide we like it.	1
Introducing MST early in athletes’ careers may lay the foundation that will help them develop to their full potential.	1
Perhaps they would automatically exercise at 65 percent of their maximum heart rate regardless of which machine they were using.	1
More generally, when we are presented with a list of alternative explanations for some phenomenon, and are then persuaded that all but one of those explanations are unsatisfactory, we should pause to reflect. 	1
Rather, we spent much time in the social studies office complaining about a lack of time and playing the blame game.	1
Those who donate to one or two charities seek evidence about what the charity is doing and what it is really having a positive impact.	0
In fact, at high levels of competition, all athletes have the physical skills to be successful. 	1
In 2001, researchers at Wayne State University asked a group of college volunteers to exercise for twenty minutes at a preset pace on each of three machines: a treadmill, a stationary bike, and a stair climber.	0
The statement remains implacably true, even though starvation also may sometimes subserve ends that are good.	1
The ironic effect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related cognitive processes.	1
They know that artistic is always explaining, refining, and making clear the object depicted. 	1
At some point, a Stone Age genius realized the enormous hunting advantage he would gain by being able to glide over the water’s surface, and built the first boat.	1
But knowing and not telling does not give him that feeling of “superiority that, so to say, latently contained in the secret, fully actualizing itself only at the moment of disclosure.”	0
Thomas Jefferson, who had an enduring interest in democracy, came to a similar conclusion. 	1
But massiveness has nothing to do with monumentality. 	1
Performance feedback requires that the program go beyond the “win, place, or show” level of feedback.	1
Thus pets are important in the treatment of depressed or chronically ill patients.	1
In a sense, all competitions give feedback.	1
Children who visit cannot help but remember what their parents or grandparents once were and be depressed by their incapacities.	1
In the absence of a process that allows them to benchmark those who do things better or at least differently, teachers are left with that one perspective─their own.	1
They are more technically called cleptoparasites.	1
In almost every case, the safer alternative is available at a comparable cost. Industry may reject these facts and complain about the high cost of acting, but history sets the record straight. 	1
You can’t have a democracy if you can’t talk with your neighbors about matters of mutual interest or concern. 	1
Therefore, people 5 who hold a more interdependent self-construal may prefer to cope in a way that promotes harmony in relationships.	1
Perhaps they would intentionally exercise at 65 percent of their maximum heart rate regardless of which machine they were using.	0
This dual-process system involves, first, an intentional operating process, which consciously attempts to locate thoughts unrelated to the suppressed ones.	1
It would not have taken long for mankind to apply this advantage to other goods.	1
Even under ideal circumstances, hunting these fast animals with spear or bow and arrow is an uncertain task.	1
This, however, is by no means the case.	1
Introducing MST later in athletes’ careers may lay the foundation that will help them develop to their full potential.	0
With this form of agency comes the belief that individual successes 2 depending primarily on one’s own abilities and actions, and thus, whether by influencing the environment or trying to accept one’s circumstances, the use of control ultimately centers on the individual.	0
If I say to you, ‘Don’t think of a white bear’, you will find it difficult not to think of a white bear. 	1
In the absence of a process that forbids them to benchmark those who do things better or at least differently, teachers are left with that one perspective─their own.	0
Speculations about the meaning and purpose of prehistoric art rely heavily on analogies drawn with modern-day hunter-gatherer societies. 	1
Eventually, he saw a need for the nation to be blended into “wards” ― political units so small that everyone living there could participate directly in the political process. 	0
A vibrant democracy conducted locally would then provide the active basic unit for the democratic life of the republic. 	1
Monumentality is not a matter of external weight, but of “inner weight.” 	1
In almost every case, the safer alternative is unavailable at a comparable cost. Industry may reject these facts and complain about the high cost of acting, but history sets the record straight. 	0
Those who give small amounts to many charities are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others ─ psychologists call them warm glow givers.	1
When teachers work in isolation, they tend to see the world through one set of eyes ─ their own.	1
Research has shown 4 that East Asians prefer to receive, but not seek, more social support rather than seek personal control in certain cases.	1
Far from being static, the environment is constantly changing and offering new challenges to evolving populations.	1
People from more individualistic cultural contexts tend to be motivated to maintain self-focused agency or control 1 as these serve as the basis of one’s self-worth.	1
Clepto means “thief” in Greek, and the term cleptoparasite refers specifically to an organism that lives off another by stealing its food.	1
As long as he keeps his information to himself, he may feel superior to those who do not know it.	1
However, we must not be over-optimistic.	1
One wonders whether our children’s inherent capacity to recognize, classify, and order information about their environment ― abilities once essential to our very survival ― is slowly devolving to facilitate life in their increasingly virtualized world. 	1
However, people from more interdependent cultural contexts tend to be less focused on issues of individual success and agency and more motivated towards group goals and harmony.	1
The horse’s efficient mechanism for running would never have evolved except for the fact that meat-eating predators were at the same time evolving more efficient methods of attack. 	1
When people face real adversity ─ disease, unemployment, or the disabilities of age ─ affection from a pet takes on new meaning.	1
An employee who realizes she isn’t being trusted by her co-workers with shared responsibilities at work might, upon reflection, identify areas where she has consistently let others down or failed to follow through on previous commitments.	1
Many people offer an equal split to the partner, leaving both individuals happy and willing to trust each other in the future.	1
Things that in real life are imperfectly realized, merely hinted at, and entangled with other  things appear in a work of art complete, entire, and inseparable from irrelevant matters. 	0
One misconception that often appears in the writings of physical scientists who are looking at biology from the outside is that the environment appears to them to be a static entity, which cannot contribute new bits of information as evolution progresses.	1
In some circumstances, it may pave the way for genetic variants to take hold in the population of a species and eventually allow the emergence of a new species in place of the old one.	1
In this case the cleptoparasite feeds on the host’s hard-earned pollen stores.	1
In many cases the donation is so small ─ $10 or less ─ that if they stopped to think, they would realize that the cost of processing the donation is likely to exceed any benefit it brings to the charity.	1
Europe’s first Homo sapiens lived primarily on large game, particularly reindeer. 	1
It’s rather like describing how you drive to work: you don’t simply recite the names of roads as an abstract list, but have to construct your route by mentally retracing it.	1
This process is therefore also known as the rebound effect.	1
A special harmony emerges that we missed before. We hear more and more and understand more and more with each listening.	1
However, it is argued, the intentional operating system can fail due to increased cognitive load caused by fatigue, stress and emotional factors, and so the monitoring process filters the inappropriate thoughts into consciousness, making them highly accessible.	1
Baseball belongs to the kind of world which people did not say, “I haven’t got all day.” 	0
What some organisms must starve in nature is deeply regrettable and sad.	0
Once the laboriously overtaken and killed prey had been hauled aboard, getting its body back to the tribal camp would have been far easier by boat than on land.	0
Competitive activities can be more than just performance showcases which the best is recognized and the rest are overlooked.	0
Knowing that they are giving makes them feel good, regardless of the impact of their donation.	1
The extent to which they are finding varies from animal to animal and from activity to activity.	0
One person in a pair is given some money ― say $10. 	1
Measurements of heart rate, oxygen consumption, and perceived effort were taken throughout all three workouts.	1
I taught various subjects under the social studies umbrella and had very little idea of how my peers who taught the same subject did what they did.	1
The idea of meeting regularly to compare notes, plan common assessments, and share what we did well never occurred to us.	1
In this way, ‘thought suppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to suppress instead of calming them’.	1
While afloat, it is uniquely vulnerable, moving slowly with its antlers held high as it struggles to keep its nose above water.	1
Some prominent journalists say that archaeologists should work with treasure hunters because treasure hunters have accumulated valuable historical artifacts that can reveal much about the past.	1
In fact, the optimal time for introducing MST may be when athletes are first beginning their sport. 	1
In addition, pets are used to great advantage with the institutionalized aged.	1
Of course, most accomplished musicians can play compositions containing many thousands of notes entirely from  memory, without a note out of place.	1
When musicians make a mistake during rehearsal, they wind back to the 5 start of a musical phrase (‘let’s take it from the second verse’) before restarting.	1
